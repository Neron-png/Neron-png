## Hello and Welcome to my Github Profile!
#### My name's Neron-Michail Panagiotopoulos, but you can call me Neron

I study Computer Science at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in Greece.

I am quite interested in the use of code as a tool of improving the efficacy of the **daily tasks** we come up against in the digital world.

### My projects

My profile consists primarily of private projects, but it also contains various public ones, all of which I am working on in my free time.

My projects primarily consist of python scripts and bots that range from posting random, interesting facts, eg. [**GRWikiEdits**](https://github.com/Neron-png/GRWikiEdits) to a fully fledged reddit moderation bot, that is used to maintain a **50k +** member community and will be getting open sourced soon.

### Languages

I primarily like working with **Python** and **kotlin**, but am constantly working on expanding that list and hope to be posting projects in **c** in the near future!
